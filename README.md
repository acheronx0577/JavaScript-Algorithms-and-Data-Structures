Developers use **HTML** and **CSS** to control page structure and style —  
but it’s **JavaScript** that makes it *come alive!* ✨  

This certification from **[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)** teaches the core principles of JavaScript, from fundamentals to advanced concepts like OOP, functional programming, and algorithms.  

Through this course, I learned:
- 🧮 JavaScript fundamentals: variables, arrays, loops, objects, functions  
- 🧱 DOM manipulation and event handling  
- 🧭 Object-Oriented & Functional Programming  
- 💾 Local Storage and APIs  
- 🧠 Algorithmic thinking and problem solving  

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Some browser extensions (like ad-blockers or script-blockers) can interfere with FreeCodeCamp tests.  
> Disable them if you run into any issues.
