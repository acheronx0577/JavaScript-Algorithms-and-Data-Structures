# 🧠 JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures 💻

Welcome to my **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification projects!  
Each project builds on core JavaScript concepts — from variables and loops to OOP, functional programming, and algorithmic problem-solving. 🚀

## 🧩 About This Course

Developers use **HTML** and **CSS** to control page structure and style —  
but it’s **JavaScript** that makes it *come alive!* ✨  

Through this certification, I learned:
- 🧮 JS fundamentals: variables, arrays, loops, objects, functions  
- 🧱 DOM manipulation and event handling  
- 🧭 Object-Oriented & Functional Programming  
- 💾 Local Storage and APIs  
- 🧠 Algorithmic thinking and problem solving  

> ⚠️ Tip: Browser extensions like ad-blockers may interfere with JS-based tests. Disable them when needed.
